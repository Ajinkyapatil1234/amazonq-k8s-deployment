# AI-Powered Kubernetes Deployment using Amazon Q + MCP

This project demonstrates how I deployed a full online shopping application using **Amazon Q** (AI CLI assistant) and a **Managed Control Plane (MCP)** for Kubernetes.

## Tools Used

- Amazon Q (AI CLI)
- Kubernetes (via MCP server)
- Docker
- YAML (K8s manifests)
- Ubuntu/Linux terminal

##  What I Did

- Installed and configured Amazon Q on my system
- Used AI to generate Kubernetes YAML files for deployment and services
- Deployed a Dockerized shopping app on a Kubernetes cluster managed by MCP
- Verified app functionality via browser and Kubernetes dashboard

##  Screenshots

##  Key Learnings

- AI dramatically reduces deployment time — from hours to minutes
- Real-time YAML fixes and generation via Amazon Q is a game changer
- MCP provides a managed, stable control plane perfect for cloud-native apps

##  Why It Matters

This project shows how AI tools like Amazon Q are transforming cloud engineering workflows — allowing faster, smarter DevOps practices.

##  Folder Overview

- `kubernetes/` — contains deployment and service YAML files
- `docker/` — Dockerfile for the application (if applicable)
- `screenshots/` — terminal & app deployment screenshots
- `notes/` — AI commands and session notes
